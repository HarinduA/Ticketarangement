# Ticketarangement

I'm introduce you to our super simple yet advanced plane ticket arrangement program. It’s like having your personal ticket agent right on your computer. Here's how it all works:

🎫 Booking Your Seat
Add a Seat:

First things first, we need your name and email. Don’t worry, we won’t spam you, just need this to keep track of your booking.
Choose your seat from the available options. Imagine you’re looking at a mini map of the plane - pick a window seat, aisle seat, or maybe you fancy the middle?
Confirm your choice and boom, the seat is yours!
Cancel a Seat:

Changed your mind? No worries, it happens. Just tell us your name and email again, and which seat you wanna cancel.
We’ll free it up so someone else can grab it. Simple as that!
View Available Seats:

Wanna see what’s still open before you make a move? Just check the list of available seats. It's like window shopping for the perfect spot on the plane.

✉️ Getting Your Receipt
Once you’ve locked in your seat, we’ll whip up a nice, neat receipt for you. You can save it as a file, so you have proof of your booking handy. Trust us, it’s always good to have that piece of paper (or digital doc) to show off.

💡 How It Works Under the Hood
This program is written in Java – yes, the language that runs half the world’s tech! Here’s a sneak peek at what happens behind the scenes:

Data Management: We use lists and files to keep track of who’s sitting where. It’s like a virtual seating chart.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple prompts guide you through booking, canceling, and viewing seats. You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use this.
File Generation: After you book a seat, the program generates a receipt file with all the details. Perfect for your records.
